To run this project you ony need docker-compose and follow the instructions

The mysql docker takes time to build so it makes the backend crash.
You can either run docker-compose up, wait till mysql finishes doing its things and then restar the backend container, or you can just run the mysql docker and run the backend and front end by separate.

You can also take a look at the postman file to see al the available routes
